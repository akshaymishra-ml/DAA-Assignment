Heap Sort and Bitonic Sort

HEAP SORT:
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.

Bitonic Sort:
Bitonic Sort is a classic parallel algorithm for sorting.
Bitonic sort does O(n Log 2n) comparisons.
The number of comparisons done by Bitonic sort are more than popular sorting algorithms like Merge Sort [ does O(nLogn) comparisons], but Bitonice sort is better for parallel implementation because we always compare elements in predefined sequence and the sequence of comparison doesnâ€™t depend on data. Therefore it is suitable for implementation in hardware and parallel processor array.
